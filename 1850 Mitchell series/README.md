# About these files

These GIS data sets are based on a series of maps created by Samuel Agustus Mitchell in the mid 19th century.

While most of the source maps used as the basis of these files were taken from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), some of the finest scans and extended coverage of Mitchell's work can be found as part of the [Daivd Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?search=SUBMIT&q=samuel+augustus+mitchell&dateRangeStart=&dateRangeEnd=&sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&QuickSearchA=QuickSearchA).

# Working with old maps

Old maps are wonderful, but very often don't reflect the truth on the ground. They may have been based on older, more inaccurate maps. The goal of these tracing is not to provide a representative "truth" of the world at the time, but only to extract the data contained in the maps. A more accurate representation will be provided separately and will require a more thorough synthesis of information from multiple sources.

Some examples of the idiosyncrasies of these maps, just to highlight what we're talking about:

* There is no Andorra, even though there was an Andorra in 1850
* Some of the borders aren't flush, from map to map. There are gaps, for example, between the Kingdom of Sardinia and some of the Kingdoms of Northern Italy
* More to follow

# Things to note

Ideally, the info on this site will be:

* Open for additions - please let us know if you have something you'd like to contribute!
* Sourced - connected to some linked source map, etc. It would be great to know where the data came from or why someone believes it's where it's shown. Even better, if you can include georeference parameters, maybe someone else can enhance / improve those, too.
* Linked - for now, connecting the ADM0 and ADM1 borders and polygons to Wikidata Q codes would be great. If you can link them to other codes, great!
* Shared - as appropriately, with [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

Sharing and reuse are good things.
