# About these files

This is the first home for a set of public domain data historical GIS files.

In the future, there will hopefully be a better organized, searchable, fun, etc. place for them to live, but for now, this is it.

# Things to note

Ideally, the info on this site will be:

* Open for additions - please let us know if you have something you'd like to contribute!
* Sourced - connected to some linked source map, etc. It would be great to know where the data came from or why someone believes it's where it's shown. Even better, if you can include georeference parameters, maybe someone else can enhance / improve those, too.
* Linked - for now, connecting the ADM0 and ADM1 borders and polygons to Wikidata Q codes would be great. If you can link them to other codes, great!
* Shared - as appropriately, with [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). 

Sharing and reuse are good things.

# Attributions

This site is not only modeled after [Natural Earth Data](http://naturalearthdata.com), we've used that data extensively as a starting point.
